# CuriousRohit - a bunch of things that I find interesting

17/04/2025
This is not just another repository, I am creating this to log things that I find very interesting on a daily basis and some of my key learnings & findings.

## Why?
Wanted to have a single place where I just offload every information I gather from the internet, discussions, podcasts and in-general.

### Disclaimer:
I am writing this just for myself, don't expect any viewers or so. If I find something worth sharing, I will share it on my hashnode or twitter.

If you are also curious like me, let's discuss something cool on X
